                        Stoicism is a school of philosophy that hails from ancient Greece and Rome in the early parts of the 3rd century, BC.

                        It's important to keep in mind how differently people thought then.
                        People's primary concern was to avoid living an unfortunate life. Therefore, they were more likely to order their thoughts, decisions, and behaviors to promote increased life satisfaction. One of the most important things to keep in mind is individuals didn’t automatically assume that they would achieve happiness by attaining money, prestige, and or beautiful things. With great urgency, people wanted to understand how they could have an excellent soul.
                        
                        Stoicism was one of the famous schools of thought during this period because the Stoics provided compelling answers to anxiety, stress, fear, and troubling questions like “What do I want out of life?” The Stoics offered an operating system that dealt with the trials of the human condition.
                        
                        Their ultimate answer to all of these issues (essentially) went as follows: I want enduring happiness and tranquility of mind, which come from being a virtuous person.
                        
                        For instance, a person could hone virtues of character by placing more value on actions over words. In short, positive behavior lead toward a more positive life experience. And, you guessed it-- negative behavior resulted in a more challenging one.
